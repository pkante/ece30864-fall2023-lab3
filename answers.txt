Epic: Represents a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller pieces (Stories and Tasks). Epics are typically completed over several sprints or a longer time frame
Story: Describes a new functionality or feature from the user's perspective. Stories are smaller units of work that contribute to the completion of an Epic
Bug: Represents a problem or defect in the software that needs to be fixed
Task: Refers to individual steps or pieces of work that need to be done to complete a Story or Epic. Tasks are usually smaller and more focused than Stories
